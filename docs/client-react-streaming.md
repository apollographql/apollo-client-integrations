## client-react-streaming package

This package provides building blocks to create framework-level integration of Apollo Client with React's streaming SSR. See the \[@<!-- -->apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support\](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/tree/main/packages/experimental-nextjs-app-support) package as an example.

It can also be used to use Apollo Client with a custom streaming SSR setup, e.g. with Vite. See the \[vite streaming integration test\](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/tree/main/integration-test/vite-streaming) as an example.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ApolloClient](./client-react-streaming.apolloclient.md) | <p>A version of <code>ApolloClient</code> to be used with streaming SSR.</p><p>For more documentation, please see [the Apollo Client API documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient)<!-- -->.</p> |
|  [DebounceMultipartResponsesLink](./client-react-streaming.debouncemultipartresponseslink.md) | <p>This link can be used to "debounce" the initial response of a multipart request. Any incremental data received during the <code>cutoffDelay</code> time will be merged into the initial response.</p><p>After <code>cutoffDelay</code>, the link will return the initial response, even if there is still incremental data pending, and close the network connection.</p><p>If <code>cutoffDelay</code> is <code>0</code>, the link will immediately return data as soon as it is received, without waiting for incremental data, and immediately close the network connection.</p> |
|  [InMemoryCache](./client-react-streaming.inmemorycache.md) | <p>A version of <code>InMemoryCache</code> to be used with streaming SSR.</p><p>For more documentation, please see [the Apollo Client API documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/cache/InMemoryCache)<!-- -->.</p> |
|  [RemoveMultipartDirectivesLink](./client-react-streaming.removemultipartdirectiveslink.md) | <p>This link will (if called with <code>stripDefer: true</code>) strip all <code>@defer</code> fragments from your query.</p><p>This is used to prevent the server from doing additional work in SSR scenarios where multipart responses cannot be handled anyways.</p><p>You can exclude certain fragments from this behavior by giving them a label starting with <code>&quot;SsrDontStrip&quot;</code>. The "starting with" is important, because labels have to be unique per operation. So if you have multiple directives where you want to override the default stipping behaviour, you can do this by annotating them like</p>
```graphql
query myQuery {
  fastField
  ... @defer(label: "SsrDontStrip1") {
    slowField1
  }
  ... @defer(label: "SsrDontStrip2") {
    slowField2
  }
}
```
<p>You can also use the link with <code>stripDefer: false</code> and mark certain fragments to be stripped by giving them a label starting with <code>&quot;SsrStrip&quot;</code>.</p> |
|  [SSRMultipartLink](./client-react-streaming.ssrmultipartlink.md) | A convenient combination of <code>RemoveMultipartDirectivesLink</code> and <code>AccumulateMultipartResponsesLink</code>. |

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DataTransportContext](./client-react-streaming.datatransportcontext.md) | <p>&gt; This export is only available in React Client Components</p><p>If you create a custom data transport, you need to wrap the child tree in a <code>DataTransportContext.Provider</code> and provide the <code>DataTransportAbstraction</code> to it.</p><p>See for example https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/blob/37feeaa9aea69b90a974eb9cd0fbd636b62d841a/integration-test/experimental-react/src/WrappedApolloProvider.tsx</p> |
