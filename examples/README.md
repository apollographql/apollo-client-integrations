# Example Apps

Just a quick explainer:

* [./hack-the-supergraph-ssr](./hack-the-supergraph-ssr) is a simple app that is based on the [hack the supergraph demo app](https://github.com/apollographql/hack-the-supergraph) app.
  It only showcases SSR cases, but it's a good starting point for understanding how to use the library.
* [./app-dir-experiments/](./app-dir-experiments) is an app we use to internally do experiments. It's not really an example app, but if you just want to play around, go ahead.
* [./polls-demo](./polls-demo/) is a simple poll app that showcases both Server Components and Client Components in a single app.
  It show the difference between using Apollo Client in Server Components and Client Components.
